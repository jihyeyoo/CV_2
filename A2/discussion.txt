1. Stereo_log_prior
   - grad -=
   - log_gaussian takes input of 2d

2. shift_interpolated_disparity
   - which function to use?
   - TA says we need to do 'bi'linear/'bi'cubic interpolation
     (https://moodle.tu-darmstadt.de/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=283316)
   - need to test

3. stereo_likelihood
   - For gradient, x-derivative of image needed?
     Ref: https://moodle.tu-darmstadt.de/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=283561
          Slide 5, page 25
   - Also, * -1 ?

4. Stereo_log_posterior
   - Should we apply alpha to gradient, too?

5. optim_method
   - How should we experiment/find the suitable method?
   - Needs test

6. Coarse2fine
   - low resolution -> high resolution 순서로 진행?
   - downsample/upsample 어떤 method를 쓸 것인가?
   - upsample 한 뒤, scaling 어떻게?
   - 0 padding?

* Action Points
   - Merge code
      Problem1.py:
      Problem2.py:
   - Test interpolation method with small set of data
     Compare with expected result
   - Test different optimization method
     See which gives highest log posterior / faster etc,.
